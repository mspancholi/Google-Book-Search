Google Book Search App

This is a Google Books Search app. The UI is built off of React.

* This application after logging in the user is directed to two 2 pages:

  * First page is the Search page where user can search for books via the Google Books API and render them. User has the option to "View" a book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Save" a book, saving it to the Mongo database.

  * The second page is the Saved paged which renders all books saved to the Mongo database. User has an option to "View" the book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Delete" a book, removing it from the Mongo database.
